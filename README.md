# 2D-Circular-Linked-List
C++ - 2D Matrix
- Manipulate rows and column of a 2D matrix built using Linked Lists
- Build an m-by-n (row-by-column) matrix (max size: 8-by-8)

Operations available to manipulate the data in the matrix:
 1. Right Circular Shift: A particular row of a matrix performs a circular shift to the right by one cell.
 2. Left Circular Shift: A particular row of a matrix performs a circular shift to the left by one cell.
 3. Up Circular Shift: A particular column of a matrix performs a circular shift upward by one cell.
 4. Down Circular Shift: A particular column of a matrix performs a circular shift downward by one cell.
 5. Reverse Row: A particular row of a matrix is flipped.
 
 Assumptions and Important Notes:
 1. Row and column numbers are counted from the index 0
 2. The data inside the Matrix are numbers arranged in ascending order when a Matrix is built
 3. Program ends when the Matrix is in reverse order, i.e. the numbers in each row are arranged in descending order
